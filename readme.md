<h1>🛍️ ShopLite — Mini E-Commerce Web App</h1>
A modern, responsive mini e-commerce web app built as Task 4 (Capstone Project) for the ApexPlanet Internship program.
The app demonstrates real-world front-end skills like API integration, filtering, sorting, responsive UI, localStorage, and theme switching — all in a single-page application.

  <h2>✨ Features</h2>
  
🔎 Smart Filtering & Search — search products, filter by category, price, and sort by rating/price/name.
🌓 Dark / Light Mode — sleek theme toggle with localStorage persistence.
🛒 Cart with LocalStorage — add, remove, and adjust quantities, persistent across sessions.
📦 Dynamic Data — fetches products & categories from FakeStore API.
🛑 Offline Fallback — works with fallback sample data if API is down.
🎨 Modern Responsive UI — glassmorphism cards, shadows, hover effects, mobile-first grid.
♻️ Clear Filters / Refresh — reset and refetch products anytime.
🔐 No Account Needed — purely client-side demo app.

<h2>🚀 Tech Stack</h2>

HTML5 — semantic structure
CSS3 — responsive, glassmorphism, custom themes
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) — dynamic rendering, state management
FakeStore API — product and category data
LocalStorage — persistent cart & theme
